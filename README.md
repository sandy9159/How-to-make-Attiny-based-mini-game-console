Hello friends in this post we’ll se how easily we can build a Attiny based mini game console.

In this mini game console you can play some retro games, which is obviously not very high tech but yes you get a good experience of making your own game console.

So in post I’ll tell you in detail how to can build you game console what components you need and how to program Attiny 85 microcontroller.

# Components required for Attiny based mini game console

Here is the list of component you need to build your Attiny 85 based game console.

> Attiny 85 microcontroller


> 10K Ohm x 2


> 6.8K Ohm resistor x 1


> 1K Ohm resistor x 1


> LED 5MM x 1

# Brief intro about Attiny 85

Attiny 85 is a tiny 8 bit Microcontroller which is high performance and low power.

Attiny 85 is 8 PIN microcontroller, most of its I/O pins are multifunctional. if you are familiar with arduino borads like NANO, UNO or MEGA, you can easily relate Attiny 85 with them.

You can program attiny 85 same as you program Arduino board using Arduino IDE.

Due to its compact size Attiny 85 is best for compact projects where you not need many IO’s and need to keep size of project as small as possible.
